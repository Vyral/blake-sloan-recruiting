<h1 class="join-us">Free Real Estate Business Planning Call</h1>
<h5 class="join-us-subtitle">Are you a hungry real estate agent looking for more?</h5>

<p>Dear Fellow Agent:</p>

<p>Need direction and focus to sell more homes?</p>

<p>I’ll meet with you one-on-one to help you write a business plan you can implement immediately to generate leads, appointments, and sales.</p>

<p><strong>I know how challenging it is to sell real estate.</strong></p>

<p>You have discount brokerages, competing agents, and hundreds of ways to get clients (all are not equal, I’ll tell you).</p>

<p>It can get overwhelming to stick to a consistent business plan that makes you money.</p>

<p>My name is Blake Sloan we’ve sold 3500 homes to date.</p>

<p>I want to help you sell more homes.</p>

<p>I’ll learn about your needs, goals, and why you started selling real estate. I’m happy to offer my insight on what I would do in your situation to sell more homes.</p>

<p>I also share with you what we’re doing that works to generate and sales.</p>

<p>Once I understand how you like to do business that’s authentic to you (referral, prospecting, marketing, events, etc), I’ll help you write a business plan tailored just for you.</p>

<p>You’ll walk away with a plan of action, with steps you can take right away, to find homeowners who want to sell their home who list with you.</p>

<p>This will help you get the commission consistency and the freedom we all want from our business.</p>

<p class="section-title">Here’s what a few agents say about working with me…</p>

<p><span class="quote">"Coming from the Insurance Industry, I knew that I would need to be in the best training program for an agent just starting out new in the Real Estate industry, After following Blake and Sloan Realty Group for several months, I found that his training program and way of helping people find their perfect home was one of the top programs not only in this area but in all across the United States. Blake and Sloan Realty Group's achievements speak for theirself. I could not have chosen a better Agency and Real Estate Broker to learn from and for that I am truly grateful. If you want to be a serious agent in the Myrtle Beach Real Estate market then trust me, give Blake Sloan a call today, you will not be dissappointed that you did."</span><br>

<p><span class="quote">"Most of my life i didn't even use an alarm clock or even know what a Pod cast was . I was Completely new to the industry fresh out of Real Estate class and excited to start my new path , I knew Sloan was where i wanted and needed to be. Under Blake's training, Alex's mentor-ship and an amazing team, my life has completely changed! The level of dedication to helping me exceptionally succeed both personally and professionally is something i have never experienced in my work environment. The system Blake and Alex instill in each of us daily is proven and undeniable - RESULTS simply do not lie ! In the last 3 months from start date, I have signed 30 Clients , I have put 2.26 Million under contract , I have Closed on 5 homes already this year, and set to close another 4 in the next 2 weeks . In my life I have never been more balanced not only in business but with my body, spiritual being, and in my relationships . Thank you guys- your system works , you just need to consistently follow it !!!"</span><br>

<p>You don’t need to pay a bunch of money to a real estate coach.</p>

<p>Why am I offering this?</p>

<p>I’ll help you for free in return that maybe, over the long term – and only if it makes sense - you’d like to learn more about working at our team.</p>

<p>Let me be clear that is not the intent of the meeting. That’s another conversation for another time and only if you have any interest.</p>

<p>I also figure we’ll do business together someday and I would like to get to know you. I enjoy seeing real estate agents succeed. It’s fulfilling, and I love it.</p>

<p><strong>I invite you to request a free one-on-one business strategy meeting with me.</strong> We can meet for coffee, or even if it’s more convenient, a phone call or a video conference works, too.</p>

<p>I have a questionnaire I would like you fill out so that when we meet so I’m prepared to offer you specific advice. When you request a call, I’ll email it to you to complete before the meeting.</p>

<p>Look forward to meeting with you. Let’s grow your business.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>
