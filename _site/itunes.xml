        <description>TODAY’S TOPIC: “HOW TO RECOVER FROM (OR AVOID) THAT CRAPPY MONTH IN SALES!”.

We Have ALL Been There At Some Point… Riding That “ROLLER COASTER”… The Up’s.. The Doowwnsss… It Sucks!!

Today We Talk About 5 WAYS TO RECOVER FROM THAT SALES SLUMP! (AKA.. A CRAPPY MONTH OF SALES!)

We Talk About:

-WHO YOU NEED TO CALL FIRST TO RECOVER….
-THE FASTEST PLACE TO GET REFERRALS
-UNDERWHELMING YOUR PROSPECTS VS. OVERWHELMING YOUR PROSPECTS

-AND OF COURSE.. MORE GREAT NUGGETS :)





We Just Shot A New Podcast Episode And Decided To Share The Video… WE DROP SOME GREAT NUGGETS THAT I FIGURED MAY HELP YOU, OR SOMEONE YOU KNOW!..

1. CALL THE OLD LEADS….. THEY KNOW YOU. THEY KNOW WHO WE ARE….
Just calling to see if you had found a home yet.

2. CALL YOUR CLOSED LEADS… AND ASK FOR REFERRALS….
Do you know of anyone who may be making a move the next few months?… How is the house?… Things going better?… Etc…

3. GET YOUR TOP 5 PROSPECTS IN THE CAR!! IDENTIFY… WRITE DOWN… AND PUT ON A STICKY NOTE…. GET THEM IN THE CAR… GET THEM LOOKING AT HOMES.
Get them in the ether…

4. SEND A GIFT TO YOUR BEST PROSPECTS….
Could be a used amazon book… $3-$5. Be willing to invest $50-$100 to invest in yourself and your clients…

5. FOLLOW UP.. FOLLOW UP.. FOLLOW UP…. IT TAKES 17 TOUCHES BEFORE SOMEONE BECOMES FAMILIAR WITH YOU IN TODAY’S TIME…..
Differentiate, Differentiate, Differentiate
They may mean to use you, but they forget you.
You have to rewire your brain to realize that they need you. They want you. If you are doing good, follow up…
Delivering value and asking for more…
Follow up with Value… Item of Value, Market Update, Numbers
