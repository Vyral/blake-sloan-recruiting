<p><strong>Who We are Looking For</strong></p>
<p>We hire only academic achievers and people passionate about being successful, who are also “intrapreneurs”, meaning you ultimately want to build a big career and a big business inside Sloan Realty Group. Ideal candidates have a grand vision for their career, high income goals, and know what they want to do professionally. Ideally you see yourself as future business leader and builder, indispensable to growth. Ideal candidates have a proven record of accomplishment and personality that’s results-oriented, decisive, and take-charge. You’re a fit for the job when you have the knowledge, skills, track-record, and personality to get the job done and you’re a cultural fit within our organization. You find solutions, share goals, know what you want (or are actively searching to know what you want), push those around you to do better, are continually raising the bar, demand to be associated with talent, and talk the language of action and results. During your interview, we are probing for patterns in your behavior and thinking, how you act, and how you process ideas and problems. If you are an assertive, people oriented, impatient, flexible, independent, intense, and optimistic person who takes a logical approach to problem solving, can rapidly deal with many problems at once, and can naturally hold, manipulate, and think about three dimensions in your mind (spatial visualization), you will be at home here where you can be yourself every day and thrive. Not to worry, during the interview process we go through all of this so ultimately, we get to know you and hopefully you get to know more about yourself.</p>
