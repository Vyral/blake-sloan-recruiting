<p>Dear Current or Future Real Estate Agent:</p>

<p>If you’re reading this, you are either already working at a real estate brokerage or are interested in pursuing a career in the industry.</p>

<p>Let make a few guesses about your current circumstances:</p>

<p>If you’re already an agent, you probably aren’t getting the support that you need in order to advance your career. Many brokerages don’t offer the leads, training, coaching, accountability, or structure required to succeed.</p>

<p>In fact, <strong>87% of real estate agents will fail to achieve the level of success they want and leave the industry within their first two years.</strong> In the Myrtle Beach area, there are over 4,800 agents in our local MLS; with an average of 16,000 transactions every year, that means that agents sell on average 3.4 homes every year. That is an extremely low figure.</p>

<p>You might long for a kind of lifestyle that your current job can’t afford you—the freedom to maintain your life outside of work as you please, the money to support your family as well as your personal goals, and the time to make all of it a reality.</p>

<p>If you’re kept awake at night because you live paycheck to paycheck and you can’t guarantee where your next check will come from, you probably long for the weight of looming bills and the threat of bankruptcy to leave your shoulders. You yearn for guidance about what to do next, and when to do it.</p>

<p>Perhaps you’ve already sought out a solution to these problems. There are numerous companies out there that promise to deliver quality leads that you can convert to clients, therefore allowing you to grow in your business and in life. The trouble is, <strong>many of these are merely marketing mirages designed only to recruit you, not to nurture your professional and personal interests.</strong> You might focus your attention on whether a brokerage offers a high split, but you should know that those don’t provide you with the highest value or the coaching you actually need. Many brokerages spend all day recruiting when they should be spending that time training you to be successful.</p>

<p>With all that in mind, here’s the thing: If you don’t do something different with your career, you’ll probably wind up like the rest of the 87% of the business—<strong>admitting defeat and leaving the industry forever.</strong> You’ll go back to a regular 9-to-5 job, forego the comfortable lifestyle you always dreamed of, and re-enter the cycle of worrying about making ends meet.</p>

<p>But don’t let your frustrations, anxieties, and past misfortunes get you down. There is a solution to your problems, and it doesn’t involve letting the real estate business chew you up and spit you out:</p>

<p><strong>I’d like to invite you in for a discussion about becoming a member of our brokerage.</strong></p>

<p>What makes my team different from the rest? Well, we don’t offer smoke and mirrors to the agents we recruit.</p>

<p>We’ve built a proven, <strong>repeatable sales and training system that can take agents, even those with no prior experience, and help them sell ten times the amount that the average agent does</strong> in our marketplace—without spending any marketing dollars.</p>

<p>I’ve been in the real estate business for the past 14 years; in fact, I’m a third-generation agent. My proven system has gained local and national recognition from media titans like Forbes, Wall Street Journal, FOX News, and more.</p>

<p><strong>Let me be a little more specific about what my team has to offer:</strong>
<ul class="indent">
<li>One of the most advanced CRM systems in the game.</li>
<li>High-level training from me personally, alongside other top industry leaders. We can teach you how to build a business within a business, and more importantly, how to clearly differentiate yourself from your competition, making them irrelevant.</li>
<li>Assistance from inside salespeople to nurture leads and book appointments so that you can focus on money-making tasks.</li>
<li>An environment and culture of elite winners.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>In a world of cassette tapes, our team has built an iPad. We developed something called the Expert Advantage Domination System, which allows us to generate massive numbers of leads complete with a conversion system to help you convert those leads into clients.</p>

<p><strong>By joining our brokerage, you’ll experience instant and sustainable career growth,</strong> as well as access to the income and freedom you so desperately desire. This is all achievable through the quality leads we provide, our proven conversion system, and the technology we use to help you leverage your time and convert leads into clients. A position on our team also comes with a competitive split compared to other brokerages.</p>

<p>If you’re skeptical, you don’t need to take just my word for it. <strong>Let the success of a few of our agents speak for itself, and you can make up your own mind about it:</strong>
<ul class="indent">
<li>Jeremy was once a new agent who came to me, sick and tired of his 9-to-5 job. Once he committed to our training and systems, Jeremy went all-in and sold 56 homes in his first year!</li>
<li>Tiffany also followed our systems and leads when she first joined—she sold 8 homes in her first 60 days. She’ll gross $14,000 for this January, which is a slow month for Myrtle Beach.</li>
<li>Baron joined us when he was just 22 years old. He sold 39 homes his first year.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Right after you begin the process of integrating into our team, we’ll have an in-depth discussion about where you currently are in your business and where you want to go. When that’s been established, we’ll help you dial in a full plan of attack to totally dominate not just your business, but also every single area of your life.</p>

<p>If you take me up on my offer to have a discussion about whether our team is right for you, I’d be glad to show you that we’re not all just talk—we can prove that what we say actually happens.</p>

<p>Then again, you could also elect to go a different route. But I’ll warn you: Other big-box brokerages often foster a dog-eat-dog atmosphere in which you’re technically a part of the brand, but you’re still left to succeed (or fail) on your own. Many will spend a lot of their time calling or texting you so they can recruit you, but once you’re there, they don’t provide the resources you need to grow your business. Others still will promise you quality leads but, in reality, will provide you with weak Facebook leads from people who aren’t really interested in buying or selling homes.</p>

<p>The choice is yours: Face an uncertain industry full of mirages and false promises on your own—or <strong>become an agent on our team who consistently nets $70,000 to $100,000 per year, all while maintaining a lifestyle fit for you and your family.</strong> I guarantee that if you follow our proven, repeatable system and you don’t make $25,000 more than your previous brokerage, I’ll personally pay you the difference</p>

<p>If your interest has been piqued, I do urge you to act quickly. The popular real estate service Redfin is gearing up for a massive advertising campaign across the USA to offer clients a low-commission environment. <strong>If you don’t have your business system in place before then, you’ll get crushed.</strong></p>

<p>Let’s get on this now so we can build a moat around your mindset, skill set, and most importantly, your database, allowing us to make sure you succeed in real estate regardless of what happens next.</p>


<p>I hope to hear from you soon!</p>
