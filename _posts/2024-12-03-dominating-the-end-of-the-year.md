  Schedule?   4. How Many Agreements Will I Have Signed?   5. How Many Escrows
  Will I Have By The End Of The Year? A Home Purchase Is The Most Emotional
  Purchase Someone Can Make. The Holidays Are The Most Emotional Time Of The
  Year. Use These To Your Advantage To Get Your Clients To Make A Move.   Know
