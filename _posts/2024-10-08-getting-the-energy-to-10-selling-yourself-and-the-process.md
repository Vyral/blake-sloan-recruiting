  You Must Transfer Your Energy To Your Clients About Being Excited About What
  You Are Doing For Them.  People Need To See You Be A 10 On Product, Yourself,
  And The Company. The Action Threshold Is The Point Where People Take Action.
  Ask The Questions To Identify Where That Threshold Is And Bring It Down.  The
  Pain Threshold Is Harder To Find. We Don't Know Their True Pain. Objections
  They Give Is A Subtle Way To Say "I'm Unsure, I Need More Information". The
  Actual Sales Process Starts When You Ask For The Order. You Can Only Get Three
  Answers: Yes, No, And Maybe.  Your Presentation Mindset Must Be "Once I Finish
  The Presentation, Then You Can Give Me Objections". Be A Safe Cracker: One
  Question At A Time Much Like A Safe Cracker Gets One Number At A Time. Shift
  Your Questions Into Their Idea. "Does (Blank) Makes Sense To You?" "Do Your
  Like (Blank)?" 'Do You See How (Blank) Can Benefit You?"  "When We First Met
  You Said..., What Happens If We Don't Resolve This?"  Make The Suggestion For
  The Next Step. "Why Don't We Start With..."  You Need To Transfer Your Energy
  And Passion For The Process To Your Client To Get Them Totally Bought In.
  Control The Process And Handle Objections To Get To The Finish Line.
