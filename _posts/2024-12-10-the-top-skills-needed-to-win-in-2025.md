  Do As Much Training, Role-Playing As Possible, And Watch Videos To Invest In
  Your Mind's Bank Balance. That Way You Are Ready Before You Need It.  Find 3
  Non-Negotiables You Must Commit To. The More In Advance You Commit The More
  Prepared You Are To Overcome Feelings That Can Get In The Way.  What Hurts
  People At The End Of The Year Is Apathy. Apathy Is Deadly. Once You Fall
  Behind And Dig Yourself Into A Hole It Is Hard To Get Out Of It. You Have To
  Let Go Of Those Distractions And Keep Pushing.  As Other Agents Are Leaving
  The Market Because Sales Are Down You Have To Put The Peddle To The Metal And
  Capture Their Market Share.  You Must Have Patients To Play The Long Game.
  When Things Are Slower Is When You Need To Work Harder. As Things Pick Back Up
  Those That Have Washed Out Leave More Opportunities For You and The Rewards
  Will Be Greater On The Backend.  Ask Yourself "How Much Accountability Do I
  Need And Who Is Going To Help Me?" Get Yourself An Accountability Buddy. Have
  Someone Ready To Call You Out When You Don't Show Up Or Honor Your Word. But
  You Have To Share With Them You Commitments And Your Desire To Be Successful.
  There Is Power In Being Able To Declare What Your Commitments Are. Now Is The
  Time To Buckle Down And Start Prepping For 2025. You Are Going To See A Lot Of
  Other Agents Wash Out And You Have To Be Committed To Yourself To Work Harder
  And Take That Market Share.
