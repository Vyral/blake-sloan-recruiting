  What Is The Most Important Thing In Your Life Right Now? If It Is Not In Your
  ___________ It Is Not A Priority.  When You Wing It You Wear Yourself Out
  Faster. When You Plan Everything Out It Makes Life So Much Easier.  Sunday
  Night Planning Sessions Are Important To Keeping A Tight Schedule. Have All
  Your Proactive Activities Planned Out So You Can Not Make Changes.  The More
  Reactive You Have To Be During The Week The More Chaotic Life Becomes.  If You
  Are Run Down And Your Cup Is Empty What Do You Have To Give Others? Nothing. 
  You Can't Give Anyone Anything You Do Not Have Yourself. All Mistakes Are Made
  Due To Lack Of Energy. If You Want To Conserve Energy You Have To Be Very
  Clear On What Your Schedule Is.  Coming Up With A Weekly Gameplan Sets You Up
  For More Success Throughout The Week. The More You Have Planned The Less
  Likely You Are To Make Changes.
