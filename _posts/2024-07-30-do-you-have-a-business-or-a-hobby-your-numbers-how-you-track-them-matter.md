  You Have To Know Your Numbers To Know Your Business. Everything In Business
  Runs On Numbers.  Lead Indicators Are What You Can Control. Lag Indicators Are
  The Results. All Humans Are Driven By Two Main Forces...Pain and Pleasure. 82%
  Of People Are Driven By Pain. 12% BY Pleasure.  What Is The Impact Of Not
  Looking At Your Numbers?  Numbers Are Your Opportunity To Make Adjustments
  Intelligently and Get To The Destination Faster. Math Is The Path.  The Most
  Important Number For You To Track In Your Business Is Conversations. Break It
  Down To Number Of Conversations Per Day.  Write Down The Goal You Have For
  Number Of Homes You Want To Sell For The Year To Get The Income You Want.  You
  Will Have 100-125 Conversations Per Deal. That Does Not Include Text Messages
  Or Emails.   You Should Be Prospecting 220 Days Out Of The Year. With 18
  Actual Conversations Per Day. 6-7 Conversations Per Hour.   Numbers Are The
  Building Blocks Of Your Business. Are You Tracking The Right Not To Help You
  Grow?
