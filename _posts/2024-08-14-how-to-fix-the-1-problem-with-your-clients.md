  Most Breakdowns Come From Not Over Communicating.   Clients Are Emotional And
  Forget Everything, You Need To Be Aggressive With Reseting Their Mindset. 
  Don't Be Afraid To Over Explain The Process.  Set Yourself Up To Be Able To
  Have A Collison Based On How You Communicate.  Tell Clients What They Need To
  Hear Not What They Want To Hear.  Master The Art Of Having Collisions With
  Love. "I Care About You And The Outcome But..."  I Cannot Let Myself Get Weak
  Or Be Afraid. Action Cures Fear.   Always Stay 3 Steps Ahead. Be Prepared For
  What Is Coming. Communicate To Your Clients What Is Coming To Avoid A
  Reaction. You Can Not Communicate Enough. The More You Prepare Your Client For
  What Is Coming The Better You Will Be Able To Control The Reactions.
