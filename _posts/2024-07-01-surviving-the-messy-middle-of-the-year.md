  There Will Be A Lot Of Chaos From Mid-July Until 2025. You Have To Be Able To
  Make The Adjustments Needed To Survive.  The DOJ May Not Allow Any Offer Of
  Compensation Which May Lead To A Mass Exodus Of Agents. Agents Who Make It
  Through To 2025 Will Make A Lot More Money With Less Competition.  Too Many
  Agents Have Been Doing The Same Thing For Far Too Long That When The New Rules
  Come They Will Not Be Prepared.  The #1 Way To Die In Business Is To Race To
  The Bottom. Ability And Skillset With Your Script Will Be A Huge Factor In
  Your Success Going Forward. In The Next 60-70 Days The One Main Objection And
  Misconception You Will Face Is I Do Not Need A Buyer's Agent.  Show Them You
  Are More Than An Order Taker. You Have To Be Able To Articulate Your Value To
  Fight The Misconceptions Coming Out Of The Lawsuit. Show Clients What Sets You
  Apart From The Competition. You Must Be Able To Collide With Your Clients And
  Other Agents. Be Ready To Have The Hard Conversations To Get Your Clients On
  The Right Track And Other Agents To Get Yourself Taken Care of. It Will Be
  Worth Being Uncomfortable For 2 Or 3 Months To Be Successful In The Long Term.
  People Run From Pain More Than They Pursue Pleasure. With Everything Changing
  In The Next 60-70 Days You Have To Be Ready To Weather The Storm And Overcome
  The New Objections That Will Come Your Way.
