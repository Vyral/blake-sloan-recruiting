  Every Problem You Have In Your Business Comes Down To You Not Following The
  Process.  The Small, Subtle Changes In Sales Are What Makes Or Breaks Your
  Business.  Ask The Questions And Write Down The Answers. This Shows That You
  Are Attentive And That You Care About The Person You Are Talking To.  There Is
  4x Difference Of Comprehension From People If You Show Them Something Vs
  Telling Them.  The #1 Reason Deals Fall Apart Is Because Of Buyer's Remorse.
  You Have To Reassure Them They Made The Right Decision.  "The Average Home
  Owner Has A Net Worth 43x Higher Than The Average Renter." Clients Are More
  Likely To Sign In Person Than They Are Virtually. Meet In Person As Much As A
  Possible.  Ask Yourself Why Do You Not Stick To The Things That You Know Will
  Work And What Story Are You Telling Yourself To Justify It.  You Get 3
  Questions On The Phone Before Someone May Turn On You. Do Not Ask Filler
  Questions. You Will Have More Success In Your Business By Sticking To The
  Process. When You Start To Stray And Make Little Changes It Will Add Up To
  Bigger Issues.
