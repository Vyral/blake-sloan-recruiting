pullquote: >-
  Once You Are Under Contract You Have To Go Back To Preframe.  Repeat and
  Reinforce What Can Happen. Reframe New Variables To Keep Them Informed. 
  Attack The Next Roadblock. Your Sales IQ Has To Be High To Anticipate What
  Could Come Next.  Know Your Numbers, Own Your Numbers, Track Your Numbers. 
  Don't Be Afraid Of Conflict. The More You Avoid Conflict The Broker You Will
  Be.  The Target Rate For Fall-Throughs is 1 Out Of 10. You Have To Analyze
  What Happened On A Blow Up To See What You Could Have Done Differently.  Ask
  Yourself "What Could I Have Done Differently To Prevent This From
  Happening?".  If You Believe That There Was Nothing Else You Could Have Done
  Ask Yourself "Is There Anyone Else On This Planet That Could Have Got This
  Done?" Though The Answer Is Always YES.  You Have To Get In Front Of Any
  Potential Issues That May Come Up During The Process And Communicate What To
  Expect. The More Communication And Setting Expectations You Handle On The
  Front End The Less Likely You Are To Have a Blow Up.
