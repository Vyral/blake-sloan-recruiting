  Every Single Problem You Have With Clients Is Because You Do Not Set
  Expectations.  Due To The Long Cycle Of The Process, Your Clients Have More Of
  An Opportunity To Turn On You.  Setting Expectations Is An Artform, It All
  Starts With Preframing. Preframing Is A Boundry You Set With Words Around Your
  Client's Thoughts. The Better You Are At Setting That Boundry, The More
  Control You Have. They Can Bounce Around As Long As It Is In That Boundry. 
  Live In A Place Of Agreement Vs Expectation. Almost Every Breakdown Comes From
  Not Being In Agreement To Then Not Meeting Expectations.  Be Prepared To
  Re-Close Multiple Times. Have It Done In Writing To Show How Much You Have
  Prepped.  Get Good At Future Pacing. This is Setting Ground Work For What Is
  Going to Happen In The Future.  You Can Always Go Back And Show What You Said
  Before Because You Set Those Expectations.  Having The Skills To Set The
  Proper Expectations Will Allow You To Control The Process Better and Not Have
  Clients Turn On You.
