  Humans Are 90% Driven By Pain. They Will Do More to Avoid Pain Than To Find
  Pleasure. 100% Of Agent's Conversation With Their Clients Is Spent Selling
  Pleasure. You Are Selling To The Wrong Motivator Only Because It Is Easier For
  You.  People Are Only Able To Sell To The Pain When They Are Comfortable
  Talking About Their Own.  Talk About Things Like "Missing Out", "What Happens
  If...". You Need To Talk About Pain Much More. Logic Gets People To Think.
  Emotion Gets People To Move. You Can Not Sell Just On Data, You Have To Make
  Them Feel.  One Of The Biggest Things To Get People To Move Is Te Switch Cost.
  This Is The Point In Which The Pain Of Not Taking Action Becomes Greater Than
  What Someone Associates With Taking Action.  Every Single Person Will Find
  Ways To Escape The Pain. You Have To Be Willing To Re-Access The Pain To Get
  People To Make The Move.  You Must Really Drive Home The Fear Of Missing Out. 
  You Have To Be Willing To Step Outside Of Your Own Comfort Zone To Find The
  Pain. Humans Are Motivated By Pain More Than Pleasure. It Is Easier To Talk
  About The Pleasure But You Will Not Get Results.
