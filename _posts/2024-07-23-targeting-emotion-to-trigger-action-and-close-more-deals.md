  Logic Is Education And Date. Logic Gets People To Think. Emotion Gets People
  To Take Action.   Clients Are Emotionally Driven. Your Job Is To Tap Into That
  Emotion.  All Humans Are Driven By Two Main Forces...Pain and Pleasure. 82% Of
  People Are Driven By Pain. 12% BY Pleasure.  A Person's Language Pattern Is
  The Primary Way To Determine What Drives Them.   Move Your Client From
  Thinking To Feeling. Ask "How Would You Feel If You Missed Out On This House
  And Someone Else Got It?"  Ask Your Client "How Would You Feel If You Waited
  And Rates Went Up?" Follow Up With "I Totally Agree That Is Why We Need To
  Do..."  Move Them From Logic To Emotion..."That Is Why You Need To Make An
  Offer" "How Is Going To Feel Knowing This Is Your House In 4 Weeks?"  Once You
  Find The Emotional Trigger You Will Be Able To Create A Need For Action.
