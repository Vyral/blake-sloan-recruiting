  The #1 Secret In Selling Is To Smile.   In The Minds Of Your Clients When You
  Smile You Come Off More Confident, Competent, Courteous, and Likable.  Smiling
  Has A Huge Positive Impact. If You Smile The World Smiles Back At You.   It Is
  Physically Impossible To Have A Negative State Of Mind If You Have A True
  Smile.  Empathy Is The Most Important Tool In Negotiations. The Fastest Way To
  Get Empathy Is To Put Yourself In Their Shoes.   We Are All Naturally
  Judgemental. When You Come Off As Judgemental You Will Be Met With
  Resistance.  Great Negotiations Happen When We Seek To Understand. What's The
  Story?  You Are The One Who Creates Resistance In Your Job And Your Life.  
  People Are Doing The Best They Can In The Moment With The Skills And The Tools
  They Have.  Nothing Great Has Ever Happened Without A High Level Of
  Accountability. Your Goals Will Rise And Fall Based On Your Level Of
  Accountability.  Being Able To Relate To Your Clients Is A Big Part Of The
  Sales Process. You Will Find The Most Success With Empathy And A Smile.
