  Obstacles Come Before Asking For The Sale. Objections Come After.      
  Obstacles Are When You Disagree With The Client. But You Must Understand They
  Are Doing The Best They Can with What They Know.     The Client Has To Be The
  One To Say What The Problem Is. Ask Them "Do You Do That All The Time Or Is
  There A Problem You Are Trying To Solve?"     As A Salesperson You Have To Be
  Ok With One Thing, That Is Hearing The Word "No". That Is Where Your Job
  Begins.     Obstacles Are Easier Because You Haven't Asked For The Sale
  Yet.     Once You Overcome One Obstacle Be Ready For The Next. You Will Face
  Multiple.     Objections Are When The Client Disagrees With You. This Takes
  Place On The Backend And The Stakes Are Higher. You Have To Act Fast Because
  Time Is Limited To Keep Them.     Most People Aren't Going To Seek Information
  Unless There Is Some Problem They Are Trying To Solve.     Use The Obstacle To
  Make The Opportunity. Overcoming The Obstacles On The Front-End Will Set You
  Up For Being Able To Overcome The Objections On The Back-End.
